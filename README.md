# AR-project by Dylon McCabe K00221640

As Part of an assignment for my Interactive digital media course i created this poster using unity and the vuforia assets and the model comes from the asset store, it has a script that allows the user to tap a button which makes the monster attack, there is a QR code on the poster so a person can download the APK with their phone through drop box,

current bugs, the button keeps moving to the bottom side of the screen, and occasionally the apk wont download off drop box and sometimes wont install
